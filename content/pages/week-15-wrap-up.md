Due: Prototyping Anthro-Engineering Project

For the final project, you will advance the development of a prototype—either “anthro-engineering” as an approach (option 1) or the molten salt heat bank (option 2).

For option 1, you will write a ~1200-word essay articulating your take on anthro-engineering: How do you define it? What are its main principles and approaches? How can it be operationalized? What are its limitations?  

For option 2, you will devise a ~1200-word action plan for furthering the design of the molten salt heat bank. Your plan should address current knowledge gaps and propose how you will use the January IAP trip to Mongolia to address those gaps.  

Both options must substantively incorporate at least three readings from class to justify your position/plan. A class presentation will also supplement your written submission.
