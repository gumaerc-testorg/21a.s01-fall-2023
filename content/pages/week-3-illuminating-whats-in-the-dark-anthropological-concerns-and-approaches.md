## Homework

Due: Ethnographic Methods Presentation

You will choose a methodological technique in cultural anthropology and give a short presentation about it to the class. Your presentation should overview how the technique is practiced and also address the following questions:

- What kind(s) of data does this method produce?
- Are there limitations to this method?
- What are its ethical dimensions?

You are encouraged to be creative with your presentation, as by doing a simulation or showing examples from ethnographic videos online.

\*We will go over different options to present in our next class.
