## Homework

For in-class activity: Bring an artifact from your energy ethnography that you find challenging to analyze or aren’t quite sure what to do with. This could be an excerpt from your participant observation fieldnotes, a part of an interview, or a material object. At the beginning of class we will do an in-class collaborative activity to experiment with exchanging perspectives to make sense of ethnographic material.
